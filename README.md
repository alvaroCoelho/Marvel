Frameworks:

Hilt - Provides a standard way of doing dependency injection into the application, providing containers for each Android component in the project and managing the container lifecycle automatically. For use Dagger was used as well.

StateFlow - Using a coroutine, StateFlow allows flows to optimally emit state updates and values ​​to multiple consumers. Great choice for classes that need to keep mutable state observable.

Retrofit - In addition to allowing a simple implementation and being one of the most used frameworks on the market, with OkHttp it is easy, for example, to intercept the request and change the way you need it.

Navigation Components - For page navigation, this framework facilitates navigation assembly and also passing objects when necessary.

Glide - Easy-to-use framework for rendering images coming from a URL

Timber - For error control and visualization via log
